Certainly! Here are the steps represented in the flow diagram for the internsctl script:

Start:

Begin with a rounded rectangle labeled "Start."
Decision Box:

Use a diamond-shaped box to represent a decision point checking if the provided command is "file getinfo."
Branches:

If the command is not "file getinfo," show an arrow labeled "Invalid Command" leading to an endpoint.
If the command is "file getinfo," move to the next step.
Check for File Name:

Another decision box checks if a file name has been provided.
If no file name is provided, show an arrow labeled "No File Name Provided" leading to an endpoint.
If a file name is provided, move to the next step.
Option Handling:

Represent different options (--size, --permissions, --owner, --last-modified) as additional decision boxes or branches stemming from the "file getinfo" command.
Each option checks the provided flag and executes the corresponding action (getting file size, permissions, owner, or last modified time).
End:

End the flowchart with a rounded rectangle labeled "End."
